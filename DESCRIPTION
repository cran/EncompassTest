Description: The encompassing test is developed based on multi-step-ahead predictions of two nested models as in Pitarakis, J. (2023) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.16099>. The statistics are standardised to a normal distribution, and the null hypothesis is that the larger model contains no additional useful information. P-values will be provided in the output.
